# De-Anonymization threat model

Using attacker-based threat modelling with a quite non-trivial adversary, namely an entire ecosystem of players and an 
often forgotten target, the individual citizen. (Attacker-centric)
De-anonymisation is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to 
re-identify the anonymous data source, often used by those that do not have users' best interest in mind. 
De-anonymisation also works to further help improve anonymisation techniques and reduce privacy breach by probing the 
potential drawbacks of anonymisation techniques.
